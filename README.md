# Module #X - JavaScript X: \_\_\_

nice overview

You'll be learning \_\_ main things:

1. \_\_

2. \_\_

## Before you start!

### 1. Install some new software!

In order to test your JavaScript code, you'll be using software that will execute your files from the command line. This software is called [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Download the Long-Term Support (LTS) version for your specific operating system.

- For Windows, click [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.16.1/node-v12.16.1-x86.msi)
- For Mac, click [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.16.1/node-v12.16.1.pkg)
- For Linux, click [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.16.1/node-v12.16.1-linux-x64.tar.xz)

After you've installed it, go to your command line interface. Type in the following command:

```
node --version
```

It should show you version `v12.16.1` or higher.

### 2. A new way of submitting homework!

Starting from this module you'll submit homework in a different way. You will be only using GIT and GitHub and work **like a real developer would**: pushing code from your computer to GitHub and making pull requests!

Before you start with the homework, make a `fork` of the following repository: [HackYourHomework/JavaScript1](https://www.github.com/hackyourhomework/javascript1). You'll always use the **HackYourHomework** version of the module repository whenever you have to submit your homework.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. `fork` the HackYourHomework repository to your personal account.
2. `clone` your forked repository to your computer.
3. Make `GIT` branches for each week. Start at the `master` branch and execute the following (note that they're 3 different commands):

```console
foo@bar:~$ git branch week1-YOURNAME
foo@bar:~$ git branch week2-YOURNAME
foo@bar:~$ git branch week3-YOURNAME
```

4. `checkout` to `week1-YOURNAME`
5. Get started with making your homework!

Here's a video in order that shows you how it's done: [How to Submit Your Homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpYARPYGQU8)

### 3. Presentation module

Besides learing a lot of technical concepts you'll be focussing on the softskills as well. Please have a look at [this](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/presentation-module) RePo for more details.

## How to use this repository

### Repository content

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. For Each Week
   1. `README`: this document contains all the required theory you need to understand **while** working on the homework. It contains not only the right resources to learn about the concepts, but also lectures done by HackYourFuture teachers. This is the **first thing** you should start with every week
   2. `MAKEME`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework. Start with the exercises rather quickly, so that you can ground the concepts you read about earlier.
   3. `LESSONPLAN`: this document is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!
2. [./review.md](./review.md): test your knowledge! this quiz covers the basics you need to move on
3. [./further-study.md](./further-study.md): looking to polish your coding skills or go deeper in what you covered each week? take a look through these exercises!

### How to study

Let's say you are just starting out with the JavaScript1 module. This is what you do...

1. The week always starts on **Wednesday**. First thing you'll do is open the `README.md` for that week. For the first week of `JavaScript1`, that would be [Week1 Reading](/Week1/README.md)
2. You spend **Wednesday** and **Thursday** going over the resources and try to get a basic understanding of the concepts. In the meanwhile, you'll also implement any feedback you got on last week's homework (from the HTML-CSS module)
3. On **Friday** you start with the homework, found in the `MAKEME.md`. For the first week of `JavaScript1`, that would be [Week1 Homework](/Week1/MAKEME.md)
4. You spend **Friday** and **Saturday** playing around with the exercises and write down any questions you might have
5. **DEADLINE 1**: You'll submit any questions you might have before **Saturday 23.59**, in the class channel
6. On **Sunday** you'll attend class. It'll be of the Q&A format, meaning that there will be no new material. Instead your questions shall be discussed and you can learn from others
7. You spend **Monday** and **Tuesday** finalizing your homework
8. **DEADLINE 2**: You submit your homework to the right channels (GitHub) before **Tuesday 23.59**. If you can't make it on time, please communicate it with your mentor
9. Start the new week by going back to point 1!
