# Lesson Plan JavaScript1 Week 1

## Agenda

The purpose of this class is to introduce to the student:

- The 2 types of websites: static vs. dynamic
- The pillars of web development: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  - where JavaScript can run: Browser / Node
- What are variables
- How to name variables properly
- What are the basic data types
- What are the compound data types

## Core concepts

_FIRST HALF (12.00 - 13.30)_

## 1. The 2 types of websites: static vs. dynamic

### Explanation

Static websites usually come with a fixed number of pages that have a specific layout. When the page runs on a browser, the content is literally static and doesn’t change in response to user actions. A static website is usually created with HTML and CSS
Compared to static websites, which are purely informational, a dynamic website is more functional. It allows users to interact with the information that is listed on the page. Of course, that requires utilizing more than just HTML code.

### Example

Examples the two different kind of websites

- Static: https://www.atlassian.com/time-wasting-at-work-infographic
- Dynamic: https://www.facebook.com/

### Exercise

Discuss in class which claim belongs to which type of website:

- Content of Web pages can not be change at runtime.
- Server side languages such as PHP, Node.js are used.
- Content of Web pages can be changed.
- No interaction with database possible.
- Interaction with database is possible
- It is faster to load as compared to the other typ of website.
- It is slower then static website.
- Lower Development costs.
- Content may change every time the page is loaded.
- Feature of Content Management System.
- HTML, CSS, Javascript is used for developing the website.
- Same content is delivered every time the page is loaded.

### Essence

[In the link is an article with (dis)advantages of both static and dynamic websites.](https://www.spiderwriting.co.uk/static-dynamic.php)

      Static:
        Advantage:
          - Flexible
          - Cheaper
        Disadvantages:
          - not updating content
          - Scalability

      Dynamic:
        Advantage:
          - Easy to pull in data on stuctured and organised way
          - Content management system
        Disadvantage:
          - Design is more fixed, because the pages are more of a template
          - Costs

## 2. The pillars of web development: HTML/CSS/JavaScript

### Explanation

- HTML defines what the content is.
- CSS defines the appearance of the page.
- JavaScript defines behavior of the page.
- Where can JavaScript run:
  - browser
  - Node

### Example

- An example about relationship between HTML, CSS and Javascript using a metaphor of building a city: https://blog.codeanalogies.com/2018/05/09/the-relationship-between-html-css-and-javascript-explained/

### Exercise

Let students fork and then clone the repository.
Let students create a classwork directory and create an index.html along with an app.js. Script tag should be added to the end of body tag(reason for doing so is part of JS2 Week1).

The end result should look like:

```
- js1-week1-classwork
  - index.html
  - app.js
```

### Essence

Up until now at HackYourFuture, we have been writing websites using HTML and CSS. Even though a website written with these two languages works just fine, it is only a static page.

These static pages can interact with a visitor only through the use of forms. Once a form is filled out and submitted, a request is sent back to the server where a new static web page is constructed and eventually downloaded into the browser.

A big disadvantage of web pages like this is that the only way that a visitor has of interacting with the page is by filling out the form and waiting for a new page to load.

It doesn't exhibit any dynamic behavior like:

1. reacting to user actions such as mouse click events or key presses.
2. rendering complex animations
3. sending requests over network to servers and fetching a response
4. and this is where JavaScript steps in.

## 3. What are variables (const & let) & naming conventions

### Explanation

In JavaScript, there are three ways of creating variables.

- var
- let
- const

While `var` has been used in JavaScript for a long period of time, `let` and `const` are recent additions having been introduced in ES6.

Three different stages of working with variables are:

- Variable Declaration
  - Declaration means creating a variable and providing it with a name. During the whole program, a variable can be declared only once.
- Variable Initialization
  - Initialization is declaring a variable and assigning it an initial value at the time of declaration. By default, all variables created in JavaScript have undefined as the default value unless explicitly given a different value.
- Variable (Re)Assignment
  - Variable assignment means throwing away the old value of a variable and replacing it with a new one. Initialization can be thought of as a special way of assignment.

https://github.com/HackYourFuture/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/variables.md

### Example

```javascript
// Variable Declaration
var firstName;
let lastName;
const age; // is this correct???

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(age);
```

```javascript
// Variable Initialization

var firstName = 'Yash';
let lastName = 'Kapila';

const age = 29;

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(age);
```

```javascript
var firstName = 'Tom';
let lastName = 'Hanks';

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);

// Assigning variables to a different value
firstName = 'Hanks';
lastName = 'Tom';

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
```

### Exercise

1. Create 2 variables using the `let` keyword

   - make 1 variable contain your first name
   - the second variable should have no value assigned

1. Make 2 variables using the `const` keyword
   - the first variable should contain the city you currently stay at
   - come up with name and a value for the second variable yourself

### Essence

Any application written in any programming language requires data or information to work with. This information can be as simple as a string, number or complex types like a list of strings, a mix of strings and numbers etc.

For example, your name and age are simple pieces of information, a string and a number respectively. On the other hand, your house address could be considered as a complex set of information including house number, street name, city, postcode and country.

Variables are simply named storage/pointer for this information.

_SECOND HALF (14.00 - 16.00)_

## 4. The basic data types (string, boolean, number, undefined, null)

### Explanation

In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. There are 7 primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `symbol`.

Boolean — true or false
Null — no value
Undefined — a declared variable but hasn’t been given a value
Number — integers, floats, etc
String — an array of characters i.e words
Symbol — a unique value that's not equal to any other value (not used during HYF)

### Example

- `string`, e.g. "HackYourFuture"
- `number`, e.g. 5, or 10.6
- `boolean`, e.g. `true` or `false`
- `array`, e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` or `['what', 'is', 'your', 'name']`
- `null` \*
- `undefined` \*
- `symbol` e.g. `new Symbol('example')`

\* The values `null` and `undefined` are very similar in JavaScript, but they behave a bit differently. The difference is that `null` always has type "object", and `undefined` always has type "undefined".
Whenever you declare a variable (using `let`), but you don't set a value, the variable will become `undefined`. JavaScript will never make a variable `null` unless you explicitly program it.

### Exercise

Everybody has four minutes to find a way to store all basic data types in a variable by making use of the typeof operator:

```js
let x = 5;
let typeOfX = typeof x; // -> "number"
```

### Essence

In this way we can store a lot of data in a compact way, while the computer/compiler knows how to interpret the 1's and 0's/

## 5. The compound data types (object, array)

### Explanation

Pieces of information often form a group. For example the names of all the students in this class can be grouped together
as a list. In JavaScript lists are stored in a datatype called an `Array`.

Another way pieces of information can form a group are multiple properties of the same thing. For example the dimensions
of this room: length, width, height. These groups of information are stored in a datatype called an `Object`.

### Example

- `array`\*, e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` or `['Gijs', 'Jim', 'Noer', 'Wouter']`
- `object`, e.g. `{name: 'Wilgert', shoeSize: 42}`, or the special object `null`

### Exercise

1. Create a list of your favorite types of food/dishes like this:

```js
const foods = ['Chocolate', 'Risotto', 'Tuna melt'];
```

2. Create an object that contains the properties of your town/city like this:

```js
const city = {
  name: 'Huizen',
  province: 'Noord-Holland',
  population: 50000,
  capital: false,
};
```

### Essence

- Object key: value
- Array numeric index: value
